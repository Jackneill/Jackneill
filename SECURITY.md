## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you find a vulnerability or security issue in this library, we ask you to practice
responsible disclosure by notifying us before making the discovery public. Please report
the issue via Github's [Report a vulnerability] functionality.
This allows us to take action and potentially fix the issue before it is made public,
where it could be used to cause harm.
